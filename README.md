### Web Crawling
The code for the Web Crawler component is in web_crawler.py and the code for the chatbot is in chatbot.py. 
The file utilities.py contains utility functions used by the main code, and main.py runs the web crawler and chatbot.
Under chatbot_project/files are:
- the found URLs (urls/urls.txt)
- the raw scraped information (raw_information)
- the cleaned information (clean_information)
- the terms found by tf-idf (important_terms/autogeneratedterms.txt)
- the terms chosen by the author (important_terms/chosenterms.txt)
- the pickled knowledge base (knowledge_base/kb.pickle)
- the pickled user base (user_base/ub.pickle)

### Machine Learning
The code for the machine learning portion of the project is in deep_learning_chatbot_project/chatbot and 
consists of the following components:
- a script to process the data from the web into text format (data_preprocessing.py)
- the main code for the model training and generation (model_training.py)
- the code I used to run the code (main.py)
- the raw data from the internet (files/downloaded_data and files/unused_data)
- the saved processed trigrams (saved_trigram_data)
- the saved model data (saved_model_data)
- the data the chatbot actually uses is in the main area of the files
